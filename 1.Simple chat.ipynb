      "*   **1 large Onion,** chopped\n",
      "*   **2-3 Carrots,** peeled and diced\n",

      "*   **2-3 medium Potatoes,** peeled and diced (e.g., Yukon Gold, Russet)\n",
      "*   **1 (14.5 oz) can Diced Tomatoes,** undrained (or 1 tablespoon tomato paste for deeper flavor)\n",
      "*   **6-8 cups Vegetable Broth** (low sodium is great)\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Prep Your Veggies (Mise en Place):**\n",
      "    *   This is the most time-consuming part, but it makes cooking so much smoother. Chop all your onions, carrots, celery, garlic, potatoes, zucchini, and green beans before you even turn on the stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Sauté the Aromatics:**\n",
      "    *   Heat the **olive oil or butter** in your large pot over medium heat.\n",
      "    *   Add the chopped **onion, carrots, and celery**. Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and the vegetables start to soften slightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Add Garlic & Spices:**\n",
      "    *   Stir in the **minced garlic**, **dried thyme** (or other dried herbs), and a good pinch of **salt and black pepper**. Cook for another minute until fragrant.\n",
      "    *   *If using tomato paste:* Add it here and cook, stirring, for 1 minute to deepen its flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Add Hearty Veggies & Liquid:**\n",
      "    *   Add the diced **potatoes** (and bell pepper, if using) to the pot.\n",
      "    *   Pour in the **diced tomatoes** (if using canned) and the **vegetable broth**.\n",
      "    *   Add the **bay leaves**. Stir everything together.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Simmer & Cook:**\n",
      "    *   Bring the soup to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low.\n",
      "    *   Cover the pot and let it simmer for **15-20 minutes**, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender when pierced with a fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Add Softer Veggies:**\n",
      "    *   Uncover the pot. Add the diced **zucchini**, **green beans**, and the **frozen peas or corn**.\n",
      "    *   Continue to simmer for another **5-10 minutes**, or until these vegetables are tender-crisp. Don't overcook them, or they'll get mushy!\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Taste and Adjust:**\n",
      "    *   Carefully remove and discard the bay leaves.\n",
      "    *   Taste the soup. This is crucial! You will almost certainly need to add more **salt** and **black pepper**. Adjust the seasonings until it tastes perfect to you. You can also add a little more dried herbs if you like.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Serve:**\n",
      "    *   Ladle the hot soup into bowls.\n",
      "    *   Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh chopped **parsley or cilantro**.\n",
      "    *   A squeeze of **lemon juice** at the end brightens all the flavors!\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Chef's Tips for Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Don't Overcook:** Vegetables cook at different rates. Adding softer veggies later prevents them from becoming mushy.\n",
      "*   **Build Flavor:** Sautéing the aromatics (onion, carrot, celery, garlic) really builds the flavor foundation of your soup. Don't rush this step!\n",
      "*   **Make it Heartier:** For a more substantial meal, add a can of rinsed cannellini beans, chickpeas, or some cooked lentils during the last 10-15 minutes of simmering.\n",
      "*   **Spice it Up:** A pinch of red pepper flakes or a dash of your favorite hot sauce can add a lovely kick.\n",
      "*   **Creamy Option:** If you like a slightly creamy soup, you can blend about 1-2 cups of the finished soup in a blender (carefully, it's hot!) and stir it back into the pot. Or, swirl in a tablespoon or two of coconut milk (for dairy-free) or heavy cream at the very end.\n",
      "*   **Freezing:** Vegetable soup freezes beautifully! Let it cool completely, then transfer to freezer-safe containers for easy future meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade vegetable soup! It's truly one of the best ways to nourish yourself. Let me know if you have any other questions as you cook! \n",

      "\n",
      "Assistant: Setting up a supplier in Oracle Fusion Cloud is a fundamental process for any organization to manage its procurement, payables, and financial relationships. It involves capturing various details from the supplier's legal name and address to banking information and tax details.\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Overview of Supplier Setup in Oracle Fusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "In Oracle Fusion, a \"supplier\" represents a legal entity you do business with. Underneath a supplier, you create \"supplier sites\" which represent the locations or specific business units of the supplier with whom you conduct transactions (e.g., ordering, invoicing, paying). A single supplier can have multiple sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Roles Required:**\n",
      "You'll typically need one of the following roles assigned to your user to create and manage suppliers:\n",
      "*   `Supplier Administrator`\n",
      "*   `Supplier Manager`\n",
      "*   `Accounts Payable Manager` (can view/edit, might not have full creation rights depending on security setup)\n",

      "### **Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Supplier**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Phase 1: Create the Supplier Header**\n",
      "\n",
      "This phase captures the core legal entity information of the supplier.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Navigate to the Suppliers Work Area:**\n",
      "    *   From the **Navigator** (the \"hamburger\" menu on the left), scroll down to **Procurement**.\n",
      "    *   Click on **Suppliers** -> **Suppliers** (or `Manage Suppliers`).\n",

      "3.  **Enter Core Supplier Information:**\n",
      "    *   **Supplier Name:** Enter the full legal name of the supplier. (e.g., \"Acme Corporation Inc.\")\n",
      "    *   **Supplier Number:**\n",
      "        *   Typically, this is **auto-generated** by the system.\n",

      "    *   **Business Relationship:**\n",
      "        *   **Prospective:** This means the supplier is in the initial registration phase and cannot be used for transactions yet.\n",
      "        *   **Spend Authorized:** This is the status you need for the supplier to be able to have purchase orders raised against them, and invoices processed.\n",
      "        *   **Always select `Spend Authorized` if you intend to transact immediately.** If an internal registration workflow is enabled, it might default to Prospective and require approval.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Data Accuracy:** Ensure all information, especially legal name, tax ID, and bank details, is accurate. Errors can lead to payment failures, tax penalties, and compliance issues.\n",
      "*   **Duplicate Checks:** Oracle Fusion has built-in duplicate checks based on supplier name and tax ID. Review any warnings carefully to avoid creating redundant supplier records.\n",
      "*   **Business Relationship (Spend Authorized):** Always ensure the supplier's business relationship is \"Spend Authorized\" if you need to transact with them. If it's \"Prospective,\" it likely needs to go through an internal approval process first.\n",
      "*   **Supplier Registration:** For larger organizations, suppliers often register themselves through a Supplier Portal, and then an internal team reviews and approves their registration, which automatically creates the supplier record in Fusion.\n",
      "*   **Multi-Org Considerations:** If your Fusion instance uses multiple Legal Entities/Operating Units/Procurement BUs, pay close attention to linking the supplier sites correctly to the relevant organizations, as this controls which entities can transact with the supplier.\n",
      "*   **Bank Accounts:** Always link bank accounts to the specific supplier site that will be paid. A supplier can have different bank accounts for different sites or payment purposes.\n",
      "*   **Profile History:** For auditing purposes, Fusion maintains a history of changes made to supplier profiles.\n",
